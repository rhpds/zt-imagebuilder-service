In the tab labelled `+Terminal+` there is a running RHEL 10 system. On
that system, there is a disk image in `+/mnt/image+` named:

[source,bash]
----
composer_api_3f3c1824_647.qcow2
----

This image was built using the Image Builder service, using the same
instructions that you just performed in this lab, and then
pre-downloaded for the purposes of the next exercise.

Using the `+file+` command line utility shows us that the resulting
image is a QEMU qcow2 disk image.

[source,bash,run]
----
file composer-api-ee3492f7-5d95-4c1b-a223-bbf04b9adef4-disk.qcow2
----

`+composer-api-ee3492f7-5d95-4c1b-a223-bbf04b9adef4-disk.qcow2: QEMU QCOW2 Image (v3), 18991808512 bytes+`

[source,text]

[root@rhel ~]# file /mnt/image/composer_api_3f3c1824_647.qcow2
/mnt/image/composer_api_3f3c1824_647.qcow2: QEMU QCOW Image (v3), 18470666240 bytes (v3), 18470666240 bytes

At this point, you could take this image and run a VM from it, or upload
it to your custom images on your cloud provider. But first weâ€™re going
to make some changes to it.
