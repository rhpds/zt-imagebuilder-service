== Image Builder Service Introduction

Image builder is a tool that can be used to build a custom Red Hat
Enterprise Linux base image. This image can then be deployed across your
infrastructure, bare metal, virutal, and cloud. The Image Builder
Service is a version of this tool hosted on the Red Hat Hybrid Cloud
Console, at https://cloud.redhat.com, and allows you to design an image
without requiring you to install or configure anything locally. You can
also push these images to your cloud provider once they are complete,
right from Image Builder itself.

First, let’s head over to Red Hat’s Hybrid Cloud Console, and login.

Click on the `+Red Hybrid Cloud Console+` button. This will open a new tab in your browser.
