Now that we think our changes in place, it’s a good idea to verify them.
We can go back to guestfish and look at the files in place on the
system.

NOTE: The -i option for guestfish tells the tool to inspect the disk, and mount it for you. So we won’t have to go through the steps of listing, and then mounting disk partitions.

[source,bash,run]
----
guestfish -a /var/lib/libvirt/images/composer_api_disk.qcow2 -i
----

In the last step, we set the motd or "message of the day". Let's verify that the change is in place.

[source,bash,run]
----
cat /etc/motd
----

.motd
image::new_motd.png[New MOTD]

Let's check the permissions on the motd file.

[source,bash,run]
----
ll /etc/motd
----

.motd permissions
image::motd_permissions.png[MOTD permissions]


You can now exit guestfish with `+exit+`

[source,bash,run]
----
exit
----

At this point we can be reasonably sure that our image is ready to be used as a base for new installs.
