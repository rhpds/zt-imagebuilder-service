== Guestfish

`+guestfish+` is the Guest Filesystem Shell, and is one tool that can be
used to view or modify your newly created image. Today we’re going to
use it to check that the partition table we asked Image Builder to
layout actually applied.

First lets launch guestfish this utility is part of the libguestfs-tools
package, and has already been installed on this system.

[source,bash,run]
----
guestfish -a /var/lib/libvirt/images/composer_api_disk.qcow2
----

Once we’re at the `+<fs>+` prompt, we have to tell guestfish to
initialize the libguestfs library and attach to the disk with the
`+run+` command.

[source,bash,run]
----
run
----

And then we can ask it to list filesystems with the `+list-filesystems+`
command

[source,bash,run]
----
list-filesystems
----

You should see the following:

.Output of list-filesystems
image::list-filesystems.png[list-filesystems]

You can also view, or edit files interactively with guestfish. You’ll
need to mount a filesystem, and then you can interact with it similarly
to bash. Let’s try that.

[source,bash,run]
----
mount /dev/rootvg/rootlv /
----

Then let’s see what `+ls /+` gives us.

[source,bash,run]
----
ls /
----

You can use `+vi+` to edit files, or `+cat+` to view them. `+guestfish+`
is also scriptable, you can check `+man guestfish+` for more
information.

In the next step we’ll look at another libguestfs related tool,
`+virt-customize+`

You can exit guestfish with `+exit+`

[source,bash,run]
----
exit
----
