== Define a Blueprint

Press the `+Create blueprint+` button and you will be brought to the
Create image wizard. This wizard will ask you to define several aspects
of your new image. Image builder can define a custom filesystem layout,
add packages to your image, and even send it right to your cloud
provider if you’d like.

==  Step 1: Specify image format

In Step 1. Image output, Let’s select only
`+Virtualization - Guest image (.qcow2)+`. But take note of the various
options Image Builder gives you for what format you’d like your image
built in.

We will also be setting the Release to
`+Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 9+`, but notice that you can also
select several other releases for production and development use cases.

With these options selected, Press `+Next+`.

== ## Step 2: Configure Insights registration

Step 2 is all about how you would like to register this system. Even in
the cloud, this type of image assumes you will be bringing your own
subscription. You can register automatically with an activation key, or
you can choose to register yourself later (either manually or using
automation).

To keep this lab simple, let’s clear the checkbox from
`+Automatically register and enable advanced capabilities+`

Now press the `+Next+` button.

== ## Step 3: OpenSCAP Profile

In Step 3, you can select an OpenSCAP profile. This will apply an
OpenSCAP compliance policy to this image when it is built. This is great
for environments that must adhere to compliance standards, or admins
that are just looking to add some security best practices to their base
image.

For this lab, we’ll leave this dropdown field blank, and press Next.

== ## Step 4: Partitioning storage

In Step 4, we can manually configure the partitions of this system, or
we can choose to let Image Builder set things up for us automatically.
Let’s choose `+Manually configure partitions+`, this will open up a
table below where we can add new partitions.

Now, you can use the `+Add partition+` button to add more partitions.
You can also change the size or mount point of existing partitions in
the table. Even remove partitions that you may have added by mistake.

Let’s use the `+Add partition+` button to add a 5GiB /home and 2GiB /tmp
to our image. You should end up with the following layout.

____
_NOTE:_ This partition layout is for example purposes only, and not a
recommended production system layout. More information on manual
partitioning recommendations can be found in the
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/performing_a_standard_rhel_9_installation/assembly_customizing-your-installation_installing-rhel#manual-partitioning_graphical-installation[Red
Hat Enterprise Linux 9 Installation guide].

Once your partition table looks like the one pictured above, press
`+Next+`.

== ## Step 5: Specify software

Step 5 lets us select packages that we would like installed on our
system. The base image produced by Image Builder is intended to be
small, and make very few assumptions about your desired package set. So
having the ability to add in packages here can save you time later. For
this lab, let’s leave the default package set in place by leaving the
radio button to select `+Use latest content+`. Just be aware that if you
wanted to add some packages, you could do so in this step.

Press the `+Next+` button.

Click `+Next+` until you reach the `+Details+` menu.

== ## Step 6: Name your image

On Step 6 you’ll just need to give your image blueprint a name. This
should be unique, so try something like `+rhelworkshop-(your initials)+`

.Image Builder Step 5
image::ib-step5.png[Image Builder Step 5]

Press `+Next+`.

== ## Step 7: Review image configuration

Step 7 is just a review. You can review the choices you’ve made and go
back and make changes if you need to. If everything looks right, just
press the down-arrow next to the `+Create blueprint+` button and click
`+Create blueprint and build image(s)+`. This will save the blueprint
definition, and start the build process.

.Image Builder Review

This will submit your job to the Image Builder queue, and bring you back
to the list of images. Once the image build process completes, your
image will be ready for download, or give you the option to launch it on
your cloud provider if you chose to push it to the cloud, after the
image is built.

.Image Submitted
image::ib-submitted.png[Image Submitted]

In the next step of this lab we’ll have a look at an image that was
built with the same specifications to the one you defined here.
